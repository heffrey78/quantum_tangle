# Canon Document for "Quantum Tangles"

## World Facts

1. Setting: Near-future version of our reality
2. Primary Location: Oakridge Institute for Advanced Studies
   - Located in a secluded valley in the Pacific Northwest
   - Campus combines modern research facilities with Victorian-era structures
3. Secondary Location: Town of Wavefront
   - Quirky small town that has grown around the Institute
4. The Quantum Realm
   - A higher-dimensional space underlying and interpenetrating the mundane world
   - Features include Probability Waves, Entanglement Nexuses, Uncertainty Forests, and the Planck Scale Labyrinth
5. The Orchestrator
   - A complex, emergent phenomenon arising from quantum reality
   - Subtly influences events in the mundane world through quantum entanglement
6. Historical Context
   - The Quantum Awakening occurred about 20 years before the story's start
   - Led to the establishment of institutes like Oakridge to study quantum phenomena
7. Technological Advancements
   - Significant leaps in quantum computing
   - Experimental "quantum entanglement communication devices" in development

## Character Facts

1. Zoe Chen (Protagonist)
   - 17-year-old physics prodigy with high-functioning autism
   - Brilliant, literal-minded, socially awkward, intensely curious
   - Goal: Unravel mysteries of quantum entanglement and find her place in the world
2. Alex Novak (Zoe's Best Friend)
   - 18-year-old with synesthesia
   - Creative, empathetic, patient, thinks outside the box
   - Goal: Bridge gap between art and science, help Zoe navigate social situations
3. Dr. Elara Vance (Mentor)
   - 45-year-old renowned quantum physicist
   - Brilliant, enigmatic, nurturing but guarded
   - Has a secret connection to the Quantum Realm
4. Finn O'Reilly (Rival/Antagonist)
   - 17-year-old child of wealthy tech moguls
   - Arrogant, competitive, manipulative, but deeply insecure
   - Goal: Prove himself as the best young scientist at Oakridge
5. Maya Patel (Friend/Comic Relief)
   - 16-year-old with eidetic memory
   - Bubbly, talkative, organizationally obsessed
   - Goal: Experience everything college life has to offer while maintaining perfect GPA
6. Professor Xander Quark (Ambiguous Ally/Potential Antagonist)
   - 60-year-old eccentric theoretical physicist
   - Charismatic, brilliant, morally ambiguous
   - Goal: Prove his theories about quantum manipulation, regardless of consequences

## Plot Rules

1. Quantum entanglement can influence human lives and decisions
2. The Quantum Realm can be accessed and manipulated, but with potentially dangerous consequences
3. Zoe's unique perspective due to her autism allows her to perceive quantum patterns others miss
4. The story balances personal growth and relationships with scientific discovery and adventure
5. Humor arises from character interactions, misunderstandings, and the quirky nature of quantum physics
6. The final confrontation takes place within a manifestation of the Quantum Realm
7. Resolution involves a new understanding of free will, determinism, and the interconnectedness of all things

## Consistency Check

After reviewing all documents, no major inconsistencies were found. However, a few minor points were clarified or expanded:

1. Zoe's age was consistently mentioned as 17 across all documents.
2. The exact nature of Dr. Vance's secret connection to the Quantum Realm was left intentionally vague to allow for development during writing.
3. The role of the Orchestrator was clarified as a complex quantum phenomenon rather than a sentient entity, aligning with the user's request for a non-divine higher influence.
4. The timeline of the Quantum Awakening (20 years prior to the story) was consistently maintained.
5. The balance between scientific accuracy and accessible explanations was emphasized in the writing style guide to ensure the story remains engaging for a broad audience.

No significant changes were required to resolve inconsistencies, as the developed world, characters, and plot maintained coherence across all planning documents.
