# Novel Brief: "Quantum Tangles"

## Genre
Coming of age science fiction comedy

## Theme
The invisible influence of higher dimensions on human lives, explored through the lens of quantum entanglement

## Main Character
Zoe Chen: A brilliant 17-year-old physics prodigy with autistic traits, whose unique perspective on the world leads her to uncover the hidden connections between quantum mechanics and human destiny

## Setting
- Primary: Oakridge Institute for Advanced Studies, a cutting-edge research facility disguised as a quirky boarding school
- Secondary: The Quantum Realm, a higher-dimensional space where the fabric of reality is woven

## Plot Overview
Zoe Chen, a socially awkward but genius-level teenager, arrives at the Oakridge Institute, hoping to find her place among fellow science enthusiasts. As she navigates the challenges of making friends and fitting in, she stumbles upon a groundbreaking discovery: human lives are subtly influenced by quantum entanglement with higher-dimensional entities.

Zoe's journey involves unraveling this cosmic mystery while dealing with the everyday trials of adolescence. Her autistic traits, which often lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, become her greatest strength in perceiving the hidden quantum patterns that others miss.

As Zoe delves deeper into her research, she attracts the attention of both allies and adversaries. She must learn to trust her newfound friends, outsmart a rival student determined to steal her work, and confront a secretive organization that wants to control the power of quantum manipulation.

The story culminates in Zoe's race against time to prevent a catastrophic attempt to artificially manipulate human destinies through quantum interference. In the process, she learns valuable lessons about human connection, embracing one's uniqueness, and the delicate balance between free will and cosmic interconnectedness.
